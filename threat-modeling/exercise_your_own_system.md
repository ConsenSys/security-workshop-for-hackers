### Threat Modeling exercise - Your own system

#### Description 

_You can either leave this blank since you already know what you are building or you can add links here to the system documentation._

#### Threat Model 

Use the [threat example table](./threat_list_blockchain_incident_db.md) from the Blockchain incident db and think how they might apply to this system. Feel free to add anything else that is not in the list but could be a threat to the table below as well. If you get lost have a look at the slides in particular the threat modeling cheat sheet in the [slides](./../slides/How_to_Not_Get_Rekt_Volume_1_Threat_Modeling.pdf).
